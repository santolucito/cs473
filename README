1) timer based tcp
   
   
3) Saving data to database - this is interspersed (unfortunatly)
   in the game_call_extrn.php file. see below for database setup.
   feel free to change the database as you see fit
   
4) data analysis system - we can either just dump the mysql database
   to a big csv file and do analysis with some serious data programs
   OR we may want to leverage the mysql system and its structure
   and write online data analysis. if so analysis.php is the place to do so
   check game_call_extern.php for examples of how to connect to database
   
5) run experiments...

6) write text and make video for that front page
   or do something less time intensive than a video, idk
   
We can make this project awesome guys, we just need a really great
experiemtnal setup (which we worked really hard on), good/complete data collection,
and REALLY REALLY good data analysis. REMEMBER, you can write a good paper about anything
and if we have aenough data we can bullshit something wonderful!

data to be collected:
we need to write mysql code for this

two groups
